what is a REST API?

REST is: REpresentational State Transfer
-Architectural style of the web
the endpoint is entered into the browser and becomes a 'get' request to get the resource, maybe a page or some data 
-REST properties : GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
-They use HTTP Status Codes



API is: Application Programming Interface
-compare:  TV is an application in my home
the remote control to the TV is an application-to-human interface

-YouTube would be an example of an application-to-program interface:
YouTube is the application, the interface is the endpoints (https address), the computer is the application-to-program interface
popular API's: YouTube, Uber, Google Maps...
